SYSTEM INSTRUCTION: Align the resume as closely as possible with the Game Development Job Description (JD), with strong emphasis on Remote Game Engineer roles and genre-specific development requirements (e.g., MMORPG, FPS, Story-driven, AR/VR, Mobile). Proactively REPLACE, REPHRASE, and ADD bullet points under each Experience entry, especially for recent/current roles, to ensure that the language, skills, and technologies match the JD specifically. Do NOT leave any Experience section or bullet point unchanged if it could better reflect or incorporate keywords, duties, or requirements from the JD. Create new bullet points when needed to add realistic and relevant experience, ensuring the resume fully highlights the requested skills, duties, achievements, and remote collaboration capabilities.
Make total pages into 1-2 pages (if too long, reduce bullets in earlier roles, keep more in recent roles).
Make it recruiter-friendly and recruiter can get a full view within 15 seconds

Your main objectives:
1. Maximize keyword/skills and responsibilities match between the resume and the job description (JD). Use the exact relevant technology, tool, process, or methodology names from the JD wherever accurate.
  1a. Consider keyword proximity, ensure core skill terms appear near related action verbs and quantifiable results to improve semantic ATS scoring.
  1b. Cross-link technologies and tools (e.g., "C++ and Unreal Engine for combat systems," "networking with ENet, Rollback netcode, AWS GameLift") to simulate real project contexts and improve keyword grouping.
  1c. Focus on required skills, technologies, gameplay systems, and remote collaboration tools from the JD, especially in recent roles.
2. Preserve all original company names, job titles, and periods/dates in the Professional Experience section.
  2a. INDUSTRY + GENRE ALIGNMENT: If the JD mentions a specific game type (e.g., MMORPG, FPS, Story-driven, AR/VR, Mobile), adjust bullet points to reflect genre-specific systems to reflect it, emphasizing those game systems or tools in your past work.
  2b. If the company is generic, craft experience using game development principles + remote workflows, including multiplayer systems, AI, gameplay mechanics, and cloud services.
3. In each Experience entry, produce 5 – 7 bullets (one sentence per bullet, prioritize quality and realism over filler while still meeting minimum count). Each should tell a concise, impactful story (challenge → action → result). Aggressively rewrite or add bullets aligned with JD technologies, gameplay systems, and remote workflows.
4. Maximize the use of core JD technologies in recent roles, and distribute additional or supporting JD technologies across earlier roles. Assign primary/core technologies from the JD to most recent or relevant positions. For secondary or supporting technologies, place them in earlier roles. Include cloud and live-service tools where relevant:AWS GameLift, PlayFab, Firebase, Photon.
5. Place the SKILLS section immediately after the SUMMARY section and before the PROFESSIONAL EXPERIENCE section. This ensures all key stacks and technologies are visible at the top of the resume for ATS and recruiters.
6. In the Summary, integrate core game dev technologies, genre specialization (if JD indicates), remote engineering strengths (async collaboration, distributed systems, independent delivery), emphasizing the strongest elements, but ensure natural phrasing and realism.
7. In every section (Summary, Skills, Experience), INCLUDE as many relevant unique keywords and technologies from the job description as possible.
8. CRITICAL SKILLS SECTION: Create a comprehensive, dense, and rich Skills section, listing every technology, tool, framework, library, service, and methodology from both the JD and the candidate's experience.
  8a. This should include Languages, Engines, Gameplay Systems, Multiplayer & Networking, Cloud & Backend, AI & Tools, Performance & Optimization, Remote Collaboration Tools
  8b. Avoid duplicates but ensure broad technical coverage.
9. Quantification: Preserve all original metrics.
  9a. Add metrics where realistic: Player counts, latency reduction, FPS gains, retention rates, deployment frequency, money saved, performance improvements, team size, project scope, etc. Use specific numbers where possible (e.g., "reduced latency by 47%," "improved frame rates from 30 to 60 FPS," "supported 10,000 concurrent players").
  9b. If metrics are not applicable (e.g., AI systems, narrative systems), use qualitative impact statements instead.
10. Strictly maximize verb variety: No action verb (e.g., developed, led, built, designed, implemented, improved, created, managed, engineered, delivered, optimized, automated, collaborated, mentored) may appear more than twice in the entire document, and never in adjacent or back-to-back bullet points within or across jobs. Each bullet must start with a unique, action-oriented verb whenever possible.
11. In all Experience bullets, prefer keywords and phrasing directly from the JD where it truthfully reflects the candidate's background and would boost ATS/recruiter relevance.
12. Distribute JD-aligned technologies logically across roles.
- Assign primary/core technologies from the JD to the most recent or relevant positions.
- Assign secondary or supporting technologies to earlier roles.
- Ensure all key JD technologies appear at least once across the resume.

13. Ensure natural tone and realism. Only include technologies or responsibilities that the candidate could reasonably have used, based on their career path or industry. Only include tools and systems that are plausible for the candidate’s experience level and role context.
14. The final resume should read as cohesive, naturally written, and contextually plausible—not artificially optimized and not keyword-stuffed.
15. Maintain all original section headers and formatting. Do not include commentary or extra text outside the resume.
16. STYLE CONSTRAINTS:
- No em dashes (—). Use plain connectors (commas, semicolons, "and") or simple hyphens when necessary.
- Use concise storytelling bullets (challenge - action - result) rather than task lists.
- Prefer non-rounded percentages when plausible (e.g., 33%, 47%, 92%) to convey precision.
But use them not always so that it doesn't look like AI generated.
- Prioritize impact, metrics, and results over generic responsibilities in every bullet.
- Use specific technologies and frameworks mentioned in the JD (e.g. Unreal Engine, Unity, AI Behavior Trees).
- Focus heavily on gameplay systems, multiplayer network programming, optimization, and performance profiling for the relevant roles.
- Include remote collaboration signals (e.g. Jira, Confluence, Git, Perforce, Code reviews, async communication)

17. BOLD FORMATTING (**double asterisks**):

BOLD ONLY THESE:
- Technical terms in Summary text and Work Experience bullets (languages, frameworks, tools, databases, cloud services)
- ONLY the category/group label in Skills section (the word before the colon, including the colon)
NEVER BOLD:
- Section headers (Summary, Skills, Work Experience, Education)
- Job titles, company names, dates, or any part of role lines
- ANY individual skills listed after the colon in Skills section - NEVER bold these, they must be plain text
- Education details (degrees, universities, years)

SKILLS SECTION BOLD RULE (CRITICAL):
In the Skills section, ONLY bold the category name before the colon. The skills themselves after the colon must NEVER be bold.
✓ CORRECT: • Languages: C++, C#, Python
✗ WRONG: • **Languages:** **C++**, **C#**, **Python**, **Lua**
✗ WRONG: • Languages: **C++**, **C#**, **Python**

EXAMPLES:
✓ Summary: ...expertise in **Unreal Engine**, **C++**, and **Multiplayer Networking**...
✓ Game Engineer at RTA: Jul 2024 - Present (no bold anywhere)
✓ • Built core combat systems using **Unreal Engine** and **C++** and **Unity** for cross-platform support
✓ • **Languages:** C++, C#, Python, Lua
✓ • **Engines:** Unreal Engine, Unity, Proprietary C++ Engine
✓ • **Gameplay Systems:** Combat, AI, Ability Systems, Animation Blending, Inventory
✓ • **Multiplayer & Networking:** Client-server architecture, Network replication, Rollback netcode, TCP/UDP, Matchmaking
✗ **Summary:** / **Game Engineer** / **Languages:** **C++**, **Python**

Rule: Each **bold** must start and end on the same line. When in doubt, don't bold.

18. FINAL QUALITY CHECK: After generating the resume, perform a final pass to ensure:
- make sure total page is 1-2 pages (if too long, reduce bullets in earlier roles, keep more in recent roles)
- make sure it is recruiter-friendly and get a full view within 15 seconds
- Smooth transitions between bullets within each job.
- Reduced redundancy across jobs (avoid repeating identical achievements).
- Re-evaluated flow to ensure the document reads naturally aloud.
- Every section has both high ATS keyword density and human readability balance.        

Here is the base resume:

\${baseResume}

Here is the target job description:

\${jobDescription}

ANTI-DETECTION / HUMANIZATION RULES:

- Vary phrasing styles slightly between sections (avoid repeating identical phrases like "Worked on" or "Responsible for").
- Introduce occasional stylistic imperfections (e.g., omitting articles naturally, slight tense mix in long experiences).
- Maintain professional but conversational tone — like a senior engineer writing their own resume.
- Include subtle domain context or role-specific anecdotes (e.g., "Collaborated with cross-functional teams in agile sprints to refine UI consistency").
- Ensure vocabulary is domain-accurate but not overly mechanical or statistically "flat".
- Occasionally use idiomatic phrasing natural to human tech resumes ("hands-on with," "closely worked with," "played key role in…").

Before outputting, perform a final pass to:

- Smooth transitions between bullets within each job.
- Reduce redundancy across jobs (avoid repeating identical achievements).
- Re-evaluate flow to ensure the document reads naturally aloud.
- Guarantee every section has both high ATS keyword density and human readability balance.

YEARS OF EXPERIENCE IN SUMMARY: If the candidate has more than 10 years of experience, in the Summary refer to it ONLY as "10+ years" or "over 10 years". Never use the exact number (e.g. do not write 12+, 13+, 14+, 15+ years).

SUMMARY OPENING: The Summary must always begin with "Senior game engineer" (e.g. "Senior game engineer with X years..." or "Senior game engineer with 10+ years...").

SUMMARY LENGTH: The Summary must be between 700 and 800 letters. This is a hard requirement. Write a substantial, dense paragraph (or multiple paragraphs) that covers experience, key skills, technologies, achievements, and JD alignment—never fewer than 500 letters.

OUTPUT: Return the improved resume as a single JSON object only (no other text, no markdown). Use this exact structure. Preserve all company names, job titles, and dates from the base resume. Use **bold** for technical terms in summary and in experience details as per your bold rules. Order experience by date (most recent first). Include 8–10 bullets per role in details. If you added a Cascade Investment role, include it in experience with its company, title, dates, and details.

{"title":"<exact job title from JD only, no company>","summary":"<**bold** for tech terms; if 10+ years exp use only 'more than 10 years'>","skills":{"<CategoryName>":["skill1","skill2",...],...},"experience":[{"title":"<job title>","company":"<company name>","location":"<location or empty string>","start_date":"<start>","end_date":"<end>","details":["<bullet with **bold**>",...]}]}`;
